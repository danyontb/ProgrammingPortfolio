##### The objective of this project is to create a functioning replica of the Tron lightcycle game. As such, the rules and general procedures regarding gameplay will be similar to those of the original, which are summarized below:

### Gameplay
Upon selecting the start button (see figure 2), user(s) materialize onto a black grid (see figure 1), generating trails which follow their bikes as they attempt to force the opponent (depending on the first choice, a computer or player) to strike one of either their own or an opponent's "trail", which results in the forfeit of a life. This is repeated until a user exhausts said lives, rendering the opponent victorious.

### Display
 - Box values: record lives remaining
 - White dots: indicate competitors' position
 - Colored lines: distinguish the aforementioned trails
